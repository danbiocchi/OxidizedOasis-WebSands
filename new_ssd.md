# 2. System Overview

## 2.1 System Description

OxidizedOasis-WebSands is a robust, high-performance web application designed to provide efficient user management and authentication services. Built with Rust, it leverages the language's safety features and performance capabilities to deliver a secure and scalable solution.

Key features of the system include:

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration processes using JWT-based authentication.
2. **User Management**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user accounts.
3. **Email Verification**: User registration with email verification functionality.
4. **Profile Management**: Ability for users to view and update their profile information.
5. **RESTful API**: A well-structured API for seamless integration with frontend applications or third-party services.
6. **Security-First Approach**: Implementation of best practices in web security, including password hashing, CORS configuration, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

The system is designed to serve as a foundational backend for various web applications requiring user management functionality, with the flexibility to be extended for specific business needs.

## 2.2 System Architecture

OxidizedOasis-WebSands follows a modern, layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability. The high-level architecture is as follows:

```
[Client Applications]
         │
         ▼
   [Load Balancer]
         │
         ▼
[Application Servers]
         │
         ▼
  [Database Server]
```

Detailed component breakdown:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
    - Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
    - Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls

2. **Application Layer**:
    - Rust-based backend using Actix-web framework
    - Handles HTTP requests, business logic, and database interactions
    - Components:
        - HTTP Server (Actix-web)
        - Routing Module
        - Authentication Middleware
        - Request Handlers
        - Business Logic Services
        - Data Access Layer (using SQLx)

3. **Database Layer**:
    - PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage
    - Stores user information, authentication data, and other application-specific data

4. **External Services**:
    - Email service for user verification and notifications

## 2.3 User Roles and Characteristics

OxidizedOasis-WebSands currently supports the following user roles:

1. **Unauthenticated User**:
    - Can access public endpoints (e.g., registration, login)
    - Limited access to system features

2. **Authenticated User**:
    - Full access to user-specific endpoints
    - Can view and update their profile
    - Can perform authorized actions within the system

3. **Administrator**:
    - All privileges of an Authenticated User
    - Access to user management features (e.g., view all users, disable accounts)
    - Access to system monitoring and configuration

## 2.4 Operating Environment

The OxidizedOasis-WebSands system is designed to operate in the following environment:

1. **Server Environment**:
    - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later recommended)
    - CPU: 2+ cores, 2.0 GHz or higher
    - RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB or more recommended
    - Storage: 20GB minimum, SSD preferred for database operations

2. **Software Dependencies**:
    - Rust (version 1.68.0 or later)
    - PostgreSQL (version 13 or later)
    - Actix-web framework (version 4.3.1)
    - SQLx (version 0.6.3)
    - Other dependencies as specified in `Cargo.toml`

3. **Client Environment**:
    - Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest two major versions)
    - JavaScript enabled
    - Minimum screen resolution: 1280x720

4. **Network**:
    - HTTP/HTTPS protocol support
    - Firewall configuration to allow traffic on designated ports (typically 80 and 443)

## 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

The development and deployment of OxidizedOasis-WebSands are subject to the following constraints:

1. **Language and Framework**:
    - The backend must be implemented in Rust, utilizing the Actix-web framework.
    - Frontend development should use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure wide compatibility.

2. **Database**:
    - PostgreSQL is the chosen database system. The application should not rely on PostgreSQL-specific features to allow for potential database migration in the future.

3. **Authentication**:
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) must be used for authentication to ensure stateless authentication mechanism.

4. **API Design**:
    - All API endpoints must follow RESTful principles.
    - API versioning should be implemented to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients.

5. **Security**:
    - All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt.
    - HTTPS must be used for all communications in production environments.
    - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be properly configured to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Input validation and sanitization must be implemented for all user inputs.

6. **Performance**:
    - API responses should be returned within 100ms for 95% of requests under normal load.
    - The system should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.

7. **Scalability**:
    - The architecture should allow for horizontal scaling by adding more application servers behind a load balancer.

8. **Compliance**:
    - The system must be designed with GDPR compliance in mind, implementing features like data export and account deletion.

## 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

The development and operation of OxidizedOasis-WebSands are based on the following assumptions and dependencies:

1. **Assumptions**:
    - Users have access to devices with modern web browsers and stable internet connections.
    - The system will initially handle a moderate user base (up to 10,000 registered users) with the potential for growth.
    - Peak usage times are assumed to be during standard business hours, with lower activity during nights and weekends.

2. **Dependencies**:
    - Rust Ecosystem:
        - Relies on the stability and continued development of the Rust language and its ecosystem.
        - Depends on the Actix-web framework for HTTP server functionality.
    - Database:
        - Requires PostgreSQL for data persistence.
        - Depends on SQLx for database interactions and query building.
    - Authentication:
        - Uses the `jsonwebtoken` crate for JWT handling.
    - Cryptography:
        - Relies on the `bcrypt` crate for password hashing.
    - Configuration:
        - Depends on the `dotenv` crate for environment variable management.
    - Logging and Error Handling:
        - Utilizes the `log` and `env_logger` crates for application logging.
    - Serialization:
        - Depends on `serde` for data serialization and deserialization.
    - Email Services:
        - Requires an SMTP server for sending verification emails.
    - Development Tools:
        - Requires Cargo (Rust's package manager) for dependency management and building.
    - Deployment:
        - Assumes availability of a Linux-based hosting environment.
        - May depend on containerization technologies like Docker for deployment (to be decided).

By clearly stating these assumptions and dependencies, we ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project's requirements and limitations. This information is crucial for making informed decisions throughout the development process and for planning future enhancements to the system.
