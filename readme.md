## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (version 13 or later)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danbiocchi/oxidizedoasis-websands.git
   cd oxidizedoasis-websands
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   Create two files in the project root: `.env` for development and `.env.test` for testing.

   `.env` file content:
   ```
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   DEVELOPMENT_URL=http://localhost:8080
   SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
   SERVER_PORT=8080
   
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/${DB_NAME}
   SU_DATABASE_URL=postgres://${SU_DB_USER}:${SU_DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}/${DB_NAME}
   RUN_MIGRATIONS=true
   
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
   SMTP_SERVER=your_smtp_server
   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   
   RUST_LOG=debug
   ```

   `.env.test` file content:
   ```
   ENVIRONMENT=development
   DEVELOPMENT_URL=http://localhost:8080
   RUN_MIGRATIONS=true
   TEST_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
   TEST_SERVER_PORT=8080
   
   
   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://${TEST_DB_USER}:${TEST_DB_PASSWORD}@${TEST_DB_HOST}/${TEST_DB_NAME}
   TEST_SU_DATABASE_URL=postgres://${TEST_DB_SUPERUSER}:${TEST_DB_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD}@${TEST_DB_HOST}/${TEST_DB_NAME}
   
   TEST_JWT_SECRET=your_test_jwt_secret_key
   
   TEST_SMTP_USERNAME=your_test_smtp_username
   TEST_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_test_smtp_password
   TEST_SMTP_SERVER=your_test_smtp_server
   TEST_FROM_EMAIL=test_noreply@yourdomain.com

   TEST_DB_NAME=test_oxidizedoasis
   TEST_DB_USER=testuser
   
   RUST_LOG=debug
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual database, SMTP, and other credentials.

3. Build and run the project:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

4. The application will automatically create the database if it doesn't exist, run all necessary migrations, and start the server.

5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to access the application.
