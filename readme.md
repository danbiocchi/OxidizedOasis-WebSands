## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (version 13 or later)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oxidizedoasis-websands.git
   cd oxidizedoasis-websands
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   psql -c "CREATE DATABASE oxidizedoasis"
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/oxidizedoasis
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
   SMTP_SERVER=your_smtp_server
   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   RUST_LOG=debug
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual database and SMTP credentials.

4. Run database migrations:
   ```sh
   cargo install sqlx-cli
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

5. Build and run the project:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

6. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to access the application.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token generation and validation
- `SMTP_USERNAME`: Username for the SMTP server (for email verification)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password for the SMTP server
- `SMTP_SERVER`: SMTP server address
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Email address used as the sender for verification emails
- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (e.g., debug, info, warn, error)

### CORS Configuration

CORS is configured in `src/main.rs`. Modify the CORS settings to match your deployment environment:

```rust
let cors = Cors::default()
    .allowed_origin("http://localhost:8080")
    .allowed_methods(vec!["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"])
    .allowed_headers(vec![header::AUTHORIZATION, header::ACCEPT, header::CONTENT_TYPE])
    .max_age(3600);
```

## üìö Usage

### User Registration

To register a new user, send a POST request to `/users/register` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "username": "newuser",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
```

### User Login

To log in, send a POST request to `/users/login` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "username": "newuser",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
```

A successful login will return a JWT token, which should be included in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

### Protected Routes

To access protected routes, include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## üß™ Testing

OxidizedOasis-WebSands uses a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and correctness. To run the tests:

```sh
cargo test
```

For more verbose output:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t oxidizedoasis-websands .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env oxidizedoasis-websands
   ```

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the release version:
   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the binary:
   ```sh
   ./target/release/oxidizedoasis-websands
   ```

Remember to set up your environment variables and database before deploying.
