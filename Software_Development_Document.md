## 3. System Features

### 3.1 User Management

The User Management feature is a core component of OxidizedOasis-WebSands, providing functionality for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

#### 3.1.1 User Registration

The system allows new users to create an account by providing essential information.

**Requirements:**
- Users must provide a unique username and a secure password.
- Email addresses must be validated for format correctness.
- Passwords must meet minimum security requirements (e.g., length, complexity).

**Implementation:**

```rust
#[post("/users")]
pub async fn create_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<CreateUser>) -> impl Responder {
    let password_hash = match hash(user.password.as_bytes(), DEFAULT_COST) {
        Ok(hash) => hash,
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to hash password: {:?}", e);
            return HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to create user");
        }
    };

    let result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "INSERT INTO users (id, username, password_hash) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id, username, password_hash",
        Uuid::new_v4(),
        user.username,
        password_hash
    )
    .fetch_one(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match result {
        Ok(user) => {
            let user_response: UserResponse = user.into();
            HttpResponse::Ok().json(user_response)
        },
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to create user: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to create user")
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.2 User Authentication

The system provides secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Requirements:**
- Users must be able to log in with their username and password.
- The system must validate credentials and issue a JWT upon successful authentication.
- JWTs must have an expiration time to enhance security.

**Implementation:**

```rust
#[post("/users/login")]
pub async fn login_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<LoginUser>) -> impl Responder {
    let user_result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM users WHERE username = $1",
        user.username
    )
    .fetch_optional(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match user_result {
        Ok(Some(db_user)) => {
            match verify(&user.password, &db_user.password_hash) {
                Ok(true) => {
                    let jwt_secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be set");
                    match auth::create_jwt(db_user.id, &jwt_secret) {
                        Ok(token) => {
                            let user_response: UserResponse = db_user.into();
                            HttpResponse::Ok().json(serde_json::json!({
                                "message": "Login successful",
                                "token": token,
                                "user": user_response
                            }))
                        },
                        Err(e) => {
                            error!("Failed to create JWT: {:?}", e);
                            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error during login")
                        }
                    }
                },
                Ok(false) => HttpResponse::Unauthorized().json("Invalid username or password"),
                Err(e) => {
                    error!("Error verifying password: {:?}", e);
                    HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error verifying password")
                },
            }
        },
        Ok(None) => HttpResponse::Unauthorized().json("Invalid username or password"),
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Database error during login: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error logging in")
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Profile Management

Users can view and update their profile information.

**Requirements:**
- Authenticated users must be able to view their profile details.
- Users should be able to update certain profile fields (e.g., email, display name).
- Profile updates must be validated before being saved to the database.

**Implementation:**

```rust
#[get("/users/{id}")]
pub async fn get_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, id: web::Path<Uuid>, _: BearerAuth) -> impl Responder {
    let result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM users WHERE id = $1",
        id.into_inner()
    )
    .fetch_optional(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match result {
        Ok(Some(user)) => {
            let user_response: UserResponse = user.into();
            HttpResponse::Ok().json(user_response)
        },
        Ok(None) => HttpResponse::NotFound().json("User not found"),
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to get user: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to get user")
        }
    }
}

#[put("/users/{id}")]
pub async fn update_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, id: web::Path<Uuid>, user: web::Json<UpdateUser>, _: BearerAuth) -> impl Responder {
    // Implementation for updating user profile
    // (Code omitted for brevity, similar structure to get_user with additional update logic)
}
```

### 3.2 Security Features

OxidizedOasis-WebSands implements several security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### 3.2.1 Password Hashing

All user passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm before storage.

**Implementation:**

```rust
use bcrypt::{hash, verify, DEFAULT_COST};

// In user creation
let password_hash = hash(user.password.as_bytes(), DEFAULT_COST)?;

// In user authentication
let is_valid = verify(&user.password, &db_user.password_hash)?;
```

#### 3.2.2 JWT-based Authentication

JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless authentication.

**Implementation:**

```rust
use jsonwebtoken::{encode, decode, Header, Validation, EncodingKey, DecodingKey};

pub fn create_jwt(user_id: Uuid, secret: &str) -> Result<String, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let expiration = Utc::now()
        .checked_add_signed(Duration::hours(24))
        .expect("valid timestamp")
        .timestamp();

    let claims = Claims {
        sub: user_id,
        exp: expiration,
        iat: Utc::now().timestamp(),
    };

    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()))
}

pub fn validate_jwt(token: &str, secret: &str) -> Result<Claims, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let validation = Validation::default();
    let token_data = decode::<Claims>(token, &DecodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()), &validation)?;
    Ok(token_data.claims)
}
```

#### 3.2.3 CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to control which domains can access the API.

**Implementation:**

```rust
use actix_cors::Cors;

let cors = Cors::default()
    .allow_any_origin()
    .allow_any_method()
    .allow_any_header();

App::new()
    .wrap(cors)
    // ... other app configurations
```

### 3.3 API Endpoints

OxidizedOasis-WebSands exposes a RESTful API for client applications to interact with the system.

#### 3.3.1 User-related Endpoints

- `POST /users`: Create a new user
- `POST /users/login`: Authenticate a user
- `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve user details
- `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user information
- `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user account

#### 3.3.2 Authentication Endpoints

- `POST /auth/refresh`: Refresh an existing JWT
- `POST /auth/logout`: Invalidate a JWT (for future implementation)

### 3.4 Frontend Interface

While the primary focus of OxidizedOasis-WebSands is the backend implementation, a basic frontend interface is provided for demonstration and testing purposes.

#### 3.4.1 Sign-up Page

A simple HTML form for user registration.

**Implementation:**

```html

```

#### 3.4.2 Login Page

A form for user authentication.

#### 3.4.3 Dashboard Page

A protected page displaying user information and logout functionality.

These frontend components interact with the backend API to provide a complete user management experience.

## 4. Data Model

The OxidizedOasis-WebSands application uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data. This section describes the database schema and the relationships between different entities in the system.

### 4.1 Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following main tables:

#### 4.1.1 Users Table

The `users` table stores essential information about registered users.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

Fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user (UUID).
- `username`: The user's chosen username (must be unique).
- `password_hash`: The bcrypt hash of the user's password.
- `email`: The user's email address (optional, but must be unique if provided).
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the user account was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update to the user account.

#### 4.1.2 Sessions Table

The `sessions` table keeps track of active user sessions. This table is not currently implemented but is planned for future enhancements to support features like session management and forced logout.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_user_id ON sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_token ON sessions(token);
```

Fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each session (UUID).
- `user_id`: The ID of the user to whom this session belongs.
- `token`: The JWT token associated with this session.
- `expires_at`: The expiration timestamp of the session.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the session was created.

#### 4.1.3 User_Profiles Table

The `user_profiles` table stores additional, optional information about users. This table is not currently implemented but is planned for future enhancements to support more detailed user profiles.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT,
    avatar_url VARCHAR(255),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Fields:
- `user_id`: The ID of the user to whom this profile belongs (foreign key to `users` table).
- `full_name`: The user's full name.
- `bio`: A brief biography or description provided by the user.
- `avatar_url`: URL to the user's profile picture.
- `date_of_birth`: The user's date of birth.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the profile was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update to the profile.

### 4.2 Entity Relationships

The relationships between the entities in the OxidizedOasis-WebSands database are as follows:

1. **Users to Sessions** (1:N)
   - One user can have multiple active sessions.
   - Each session belongs to exactly one user.
   - This relationship is established by the `user_id` foreign key in the `sessions` table.

2. **Users to User_Profiles** (1:1)
   - Each user has at most one user profile.
   - Each user profile belongs to exactly one user.
   - This relationship is established by the `user_id` primary key in the `user_profiles` table, which is also a foreign key to the `users` table.

### 4.3 Data Access Layer

The data access layer in OxidizedOasis-WebSands is implemented using SQLx, which provides type-safe database interactions. Here's an example of how the data access layer is structured for the `User` entity:

```rust
use sqlx::FromRow;
use uuid::Uuid;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, FromRow)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub username: String,
    pub password_hash: String,
    pub email: Option<String>,
    pub created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    pub updated_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}

impl User {
    pub async fn find_by_id(pool: &PgPool, id: Uuid) -> Result<Option<Self>, sqlx::Error> {
        sqlx::query_as!(
            Self,
            "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1",
            id
        )
        .fetch_optional(pool)
        .await
    }

    pub async fn create(pool: &PgPool, username: &str, password_hash: &str, email: Option<&str>) -> Result<Self, sqlx::Error> {
        sqlx::query_as!(
            Self,
            "INSERT INTO users (id, username, password_hash, email) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4) RETURNING *",
            Uuid::new_v4(),
            username,
            password_hash,
            email
        )
        .fetch_one(pool)
        .await
    }

    // Additional methods for update, delete, etc.
}
```

This structure allows for type-safe database queries and seamless integration with the Rust application code.

### 4.4 Data Validation and Integrity

To maintain data integrity and consistency, the following measures are implemented:

1. **Unique Constraints**: The `username` and `email` fields in the `users` table have unique constraints to prevent duplicate entries.

2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: The `sessions` and `user_profiles` tables have foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity with the `users` table.

3. **Input Validation**: Before inserting or updating data, the application performs validation checks to ensure data meets the required format and constraints.

4. **Indexing**: Appropriate indexes are created on frequently queried fields to improve query performance.

### 4.5 Future Enhancements

As the application evolves, the following enhancements to the data model are being considered:

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Introducing a `roles` table to support different user roles and permissions.

2. **Audit Logging**: Implementing an `audit_logs` table to track important user actions for security and compliance purposes.

3. **Password Reset**: Adding a `password_reset_tokens` table to support secure password reset functionality.

4. **User Preferences**: Extending the `user_profiles` table or creating a separate `user_preferences` table to store user-specific application settings.

These future enhancements will be designed and implemented with backward compatibility in mind to minimize disruption to existing functionality.

Example of basic Actix-web setup:
```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

async fn hello() -> impl Responder {
    "Hello, OxidizedOasis-WebSands!"
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/", web::get().to(hello))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

#### 7.1.2 Database Interaction

- **ORM**: SQLx
   - Version: 0.6.3
   - Rationale: SQLx provides compile-time checked queries and async support, aligning well with Rust's safety principles.

Example of SQLx query:
```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPool;

async fn get_user(pool: &PgPool, user_id: i32) -> Result<User, sqlx::Error> {
    sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1",
        user_id
    )
    .fetch_one(pool)
    .await
}
```

#### 7.1.3 Frontend (for demo interface)

- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework**: None (vanilla JS for simplicity in the demo interface)
   - Future consideration: Potential integration with a Rust-based frontend framework like Yew or a popular JavaScript framework like React.

edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.3.1"
sqlx = { version = "0.6.3", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "postgres", "uuid", "chrono"] }
tokio = { version = "1.28", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
env_logger = "0.10.0"
log = "0.4.17"
```

#### 7.2.4 Database Management

- **DBMS**: PostgreSQL 13 or later
- **GUI Tool**: pgAdmin 4 (for database administration and query testing)

#### 7.2.5 API Testing

- **Tool**: Postman
   - Used for testing and documenting API endpoints.

#### 7.2.6 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Service**: GitHub Actions
   - Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.

Example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```yaml
name: Rust CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    - name: Run tests
      run: cargo test --verbose
```

### 7.3 Coding Standards and Best Practices

#### 7.3.1 Rust Code Style

- Follow the official Rust style guide as outlined in the Rust Book.
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent code formatting.
- Adhere to Rust naming conventions:
   - `snake_case` for variables and functions
   - `CamelCase` for types and traits
   - `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

#### 7.3.2 Documentation

- Use rustdoc comments (`///`) for public APIs.
- Include examples in documentation where appropriate.

Example of well-documented function:
```rust
/// Authenticates a user and returns a JWT if successful.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `pool` - A reference to the database connection pool.
/// * `username` - The username of the user trying to authenticate.
/// * `password` - The password of the user trying to authenticate.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `Result` containing the JWT string if authentication is successful,
/// or an `AuthError` if authentication fails.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let pool = establish_connection().await?;
/// let jwt = authenticate_user(&pool, "johndoe", "password123").await?;
/// ```
pub async fn authenticate_user(
    pool: &PgPool,
    username: &str,
    password: &str,
) -> Result<String, AuthError> {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

#### 7.3.3 Error Handling

- Use Rust's `Result` type for error handling.
- Create custom error types for different modules or concerns.
- Provide context when propagating errors using the `?` operator.

Example of custom error type:
```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum AuthError {
    #[error("Invalid credentials")]
    InvalidCredentials,
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    DatabaseError(#[from] sqlx::Error),
    #[error("Token creation error: {0}")]
    TokenCreationError(#[from] jsonwebtoken::errors::Error),
}
```

#### 7.3.4 Testing

- Write unit tests for all non-trivial functions.
- Use integration tests for testing API endpoints.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

Example of a test module:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use tokio;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_authenticate_user_valid_credentials() {
        let pool = establish_test_connection().await;
        let result = authenticate_user(&pool, "testuser", "correctpassword").await;
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_authenticate_user_invalid_credentials() {
        let pool = establish_test_connection().await;
        let result = authenticate_user(&pool, "testuser", "wrongpassword").await;
        assert!(matches!(result, Err(AuthError::InvalidCredentials)));
    }
}
```

#### 7.3.5 Security Practices

- Never store plain-text passwords; always use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

Example of secure password hashing:
```rust
use bcrypt::{hash, verify, DEFAULT_COST};

pub fn hash_password(password: &str) -> Result<String, bcrypt::BcryptError> {
    hash(password, DEFAULT_COST)
}

pub fn verify_password(password: &str, hash: &str) -> Result<bool, bcrypt::BcryptError> {
    verify(password, hash)
}
```

#### 7.3.6 Performance Considerations

- Use asynchronous programming with `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data.
- Use connection pooling for database connections.

Example of database connection pooling:
```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;

pub async fn establish_connection() -> Result<PgPool, sqlx::Error> {
    let database_url = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    
    PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect(&database_url)
        .await
}
```

By adhering to these implementation details, coding standards, and best practices, the OxidizedOasis-WebSands project aims to maintain a high-quality, performant, and secure codebase that is easy to understand and maintain.

## 8. Testing

This section outlines the testing strategies and methodologies employed in the OxidizedOasis-WebSands project to ensure software quality, reliability, and performance.

### 8.1 Test Approach

The testing approach for OxidizedOasis-WebSands follows these key principles:

1. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are integrated into the development process and run automatically on each code commit.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Where applicable, tests are written before the implementation code.
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage across all layers of the application.
4. **Automation**: Emphasis on automated testing to ensure consistency and enable frequent execution.

### 8.2 Test Categories

#### 8.2.1 Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation.

**Tools**:
- Rust's built-in testing framework
- `tokio` for asynchronous test cases

**Example Unit Test**:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use tokio;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_hash_password() {
        let password = "secure_password123";
        let hashed = hash_password(password).await.unwrap();
        
        assert!(verify_password(password, &hashed).await.unwrap());
        assert!(!verify_password("wrong_password", &hashed).await.unwrap());
    }
}
```

#### 8.2.2 Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interaction between different components of the system.

**Tools**:
- `actix-rt` for testing Actix-based services
- `reqwest` for HTTP client in tests

**Example Integration Test**:

```rust
#[actix_rt::test]
async fn test_user_registration() {
    let app = test::init_service(
        App::new()
            .service(web::resource("/register").route(web::post().to(register_user)))
    ).await;

    let req = test::TestRequest::post()
        .uri("/register")
        .set_json(&json!({
            "username": "testuser",
            "password": "password123"
        }))
        .to_request();

    let resp = test::call_service(&app, req).await;
    assert_eq!(resp.status(), StatusCode::OK);

    let result: Value = test::read_body_json(resp).await;
    assert_eq!(result["username"], "testuser");
}
```

#### 8.2.3 API Testing

API tests ensure that the exposed endpoints behave correctly.

**Tools**:
- Postman for manual API testing and documentation
- `actix-rt` for automated API testing

**Example API Test**:

```rust
#[actix_rt::test]
async fn test_login_api() {
    let app = test::init_service(
        App::new()
            .service(web::resource("/login").route(web::post().to(login)))
    ).await;

    let req = test::TestRequest::post()
        .uri("/login")
        .set_json(&json!({
            "username": "existinguser",
            "password": "correctpassword"
        }))
        .to_request();

    let resp = test::call_service(&app, req).await;
    assert_eq!(resp.status(), StatusCode::OK);

    let result: Value = test::read_body_json(resp).await;
    assert!(result.get("token").is_some());
}
```

#### 9.1.1 High-Level Architecture

```
[Load Balancer/Ingress]
         |
    [Kubernetes Cluster]
         |
    -----------------------------
    |                |          |
[Web Service]  [Auth Service]  [DB]
```

#### 9.1.2 Components

1. **Load Balancer**: Nginx Ingress Controller
2. **Web Service**: Rust application running in Docker containers
3. **Auth Service**: Separate service for handling authentication (future implementation)
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL database running in a stateful set

### 9.2 Deployment Process

The deployment process follows a Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, automating the release process from code commit to production deployment.

#### 9.2.1 CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes code to the main branch
2. **Automated Tests**: GitHub Actions runs the test suite
3. **Build Docker Image**: On successful tests, a Docker image is built
4. **Push to Registry**: The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR)
5. **Deploy to Staging**: The new image is deployed to a staging environment
6. **Integration Tests**: Automated integration tests are run in the staging environment
7. **Manual Approval**: Optional manual approval step for production deployment
8. **Deploy to Production**: The new image is deployed to the production Kubernetes cluster

#### 9.2.2 Deployment Script

Example deployment script using `kubectl`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
DEPLOYMENT_NAME="oxidizedoasis-websands"
DOCKER_IMAGE="your-registry/oxidizedoasis-websands:latest"
NAMESPACE="production"

# Update the deployment with the new image
kubectl set image deployment/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME $DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$DOCKER_IMAGE -n $NAMESPACE

# Check the rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE

# If the rollout fails, undo the changes
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Deployment failed, rolling back..."
    kubectl rollout undo deployment/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
    exit 1
fi

echo "Deployment successful!"
```

### 9.3 System Dependencies

#### 9.3.1 Runtime Dependencies

- **Operating System**: Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker 20.10 or later
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes 1.21 or later
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13 or later

#### 9.3.2 External Services

- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and alerting
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets and credentials

### 9.4 Configuration Management

#### 9.4.1 Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables, which are injected into the containers at runtime.

Example Kubernetes ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: oxidizedoasis-config
  namespace: production
data:
  RUST_LOG: "info"
  DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:password@db-service:5432/oxidizedoasis"
  JWT_SECRET: "your-secret-key"
```

#### 9.4.2 Kubernetes Secrets

Sensitive information is stored in Kubernetes Secrets.

Example Secret creation:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic db-secrets \
    --from-literal=DB_USER=myuser \
    --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD=mypassword \
    -n production
```

### 9.5 Database Migration

Database migrations are run as part of the deployment process using SQLx migrations.

Example migration script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run database migrations
sqlx migrate run

# Check if migrations were successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Database migration failed, aborting deployment"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Database migration successful"
```

### 9.6 Scaling Strategy

OxidizedOasis-WebSands is designed to scale horizontally. The Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is used to automatically adjust the number of running pods based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.

Example HPA configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: oxidizedoasis-hpa
  namespace: production
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: oxidizedoasis-websands
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      targetAverageUtilization: 50
```

### 9.7 Monitoring and Logging

#### 9.7.1 Prometheus Metrics

The application exposes metrics in Prometheus format. A `/metrics` endpoint is available for scraping.

Example Prometheus scrape configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'oxidizedoasis'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        regex: oxidizedoasis-websands
        action: keep
```

#### 9.7.2 Logging

Application logs are sent to stdout/stderr and collected by Fluentd, which forwards them to Elasticsearch.

Example Fluentd configuration:

```
<match kubernetes.**oxidizedoasis**>
  @type elasticsearch
  host elasticsearch-client.logging
  port 9200
  logstash_format true
  logstash_prefix oxidizedoasis
  <buffer>
    flush_interval 5s
  </buffer>
</match>
```

### 9.8 Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues, the following rollback procedure is in place:

1. Automated rollback if the deployment script detects failures
2. Manual rollback using Kubernetes rollout:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/oxidizedoasis-websands -n production
```

3. Database rollback using SQLx down migrations if necessary:

```bash
sqlx migrate revert
```

### 9.9 Disaster Recovery

1. Regular database backups are performed and stored in a secure, off-site location
2. A disaster recovery plan is documented and tested periodically
3. Multi-region deployment is considered for future implementation to improve availability and disaster recovery capabilities

By following this deployment strategy, OxidizedOasis-WebSands ensures a reliable, scalable, and maintainable production environment. Regular reviews and updates to this deployment process will be conducted to incorporate new best practices and technologies as they emerge.

4. User clicks the link, token is validated
5. User's email is marked as verified in the database

Potential implementation:

```rust
use lettre::{Message, SmtpTransport, Transport};
use uuid::Uuid;

async fn send_verification_email(user: &User) -> Result<(), EmailError> {
    let token = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    
    // Store token in database with expiration
    store_verification_token(user.id, &token).await?;
    
    let email = Message::builder()
        .from("noreply@oxidizedoasis.com".parse().unwrap())
        .to(user.email.parse().unwrap())
        .subject("Verify Your OxidizedOasis Account")
        .body(format!("Click here to verify your account: https://oxidizedoasis.com/verify/{}", token))
        .unwrap();

    let mailer = SmtpTransport::relay("smtp.gmail.com")
        .unwrap()
        .credentials(credentials)

        UserGrowthStats,
        r#"
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) as total_users,
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') as new_users_last_week,
            COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE last_login >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') as active_users_last_month
        FROM users
        "#
    )
    .fetch_one(pool)
    .await
}
```

### 11.4 API Enhancements
