## 3. System Features

### 3.1 User Management

The User Management feature is a core component of OxidizedOasis-WebSands, providing functionality for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

#### 3.1.1 User Registration

The system now includes email verification for new user registrations.

**Updated Implementation:**

```
#[post("/users")]
pub async fn create_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<CreateUser>) -> impl Responder {
    let password_hash = match hash(user.password.as_bytes(), DEFAULT_COST) {
        Ok(hash) => hash,
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to hash password: {:?}", e);
            return HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to create user");
        }
    };

    let result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "INSERT INTO users (id, username, password_hash) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id, username, password_hash",
        Uuid::new_v4(),
        user.username,
        password_hash
    )
    .fetch_one(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match result {
        Ok(user) => {
            let user_response: UserResponse = user.into();
            HttpResponse::Ok().json(user_response)
        },
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to create user: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to create user")
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.2 User Authentication

The system provides secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

**Requirements:**
- Users must be able to log in with their username and password.
- The system must validate credentials and issue a JWT upon successful authentication.
- JWTs must have an expiration time to enhance security.

**Implementation:**

```
#[post("/users/login")]
pub async fn login_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<LoginUser>) -> impl Responder {
    let user_result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM users WHERE username = $1",
        user.username
    )
    .fetch_optional(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match user_result {
        Ok(Some(db_user)) => {
            match verify(&user.password, &db_user.password_hash) {
                Ok(true) => {
                    let jwt_secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be set");
                    match auth::create_jwt(db_user.id, &jwt_secret) {
                        Ok(token) => {
                            let user_response: UserResponse = db_user.into();
                            HttpResponse::Ok().json(serde_json::json!({
                                "message": "Login successful",
                                "token": token,
                                "user": user_response
                            }))
                        },
                        Err(e) => {
                            error!("Failed to create JWT: {:?}", e);
                            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error during login")
                        }
                    }
                },
                Ok(false) => HttpResponse::Unauthorized().json("Invalid username or password"),
                Err(e) => {
                    error!("Error verifying password: {:?}", e);
                    HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error verifying password")
                },
            }
        },
        Ok(None) => HttpResponse::Unauthorized().json("Invalid username or password"),
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Database error during login: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error logging in")
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Profile Management

Users can view and update their profile information.

**Requirements:**
- Authenticated users must be able to view their profile details.
- Users should be able to update certain profile fields (e.g., email, display name).
- Profile updates must be validated before being saved to the database.

**Implementation:**

```
#[get("/users/{id}")]
pub async fn get_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, id: web::Path<Uuid>, _: BearerAuth) -> impl Responder {
    let result = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM users WHERE id = $1",
        id.into_inner()
    )
    .fetch_optional(pool.get_ref())
    .await;

    match result {
        Ok(Some(user)) => {
            let user_response: UserResponse = user.into();
            HttpResponse::Ok().json(user_response)
        },
        Ok(None) => HttpResponse::NotFound().json("User not found"),
        Err(e) => {
            error!("Failed to get user: {:?}", e);
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to get user")
        }
    }
}

#[put("/users/{id}")]
pub async fn update_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, id: web::Path<Uuid>, user: web::Json<UpdateUser>, _: BearerAuth) -> impl Responder {
    // Implementation for updating user profile
    // (Code omitted for brevity, similar structure to get_user with additional update logic)
}
```

### 3.2 Security Features

OxidizedOasis-WebSands implements several security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### 3.2.1 Password Hashing

All user passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm before storage.

**Implementation:**

```
use bcrypt::{hash, verify, DEFAULT_COST};

// In user creation
let password_hash = hash(user.password.as_bytes(), DEFAULT_COST)?;

// In user authentication
let is_valid = verify(&user.password, &db_user.password_hash)?;
```

#### 3.2.2 JWT-based Authentication

JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless authentication.

**Implementation:**

```
use jsonwebtoken::{encode, decode, Header, Validation, EncodingKey, DecodingKey};

pub fn create_jwt(user_id: Uuid, secret: &str) -> Result<String, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let expiration = Utc::now()
        .checked_add_signed(Duration::hours(24))
        .expect("valid timestamp")
        .timestamp();

    let claims = Claims {
        sub: user_id,
        exp: expiration,
        iat: Utc::now().timestamp(),
    };

    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()))
}

pub fn validate_jwt(token: &str, secret: &str) -> Result<Claims, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let validation = Validation::default();
    let token_data = decode::<Claims>(token, &DecodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()), &validation)?;
    Ok(token_data.claims)
}
```

#### 3.2.3 CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to control which domains can access the API.

**Implementation:**

```
use actix_cors::Cors;

let cors = Cors::default()
    .allow_any_origin()
    .allow_any_method()
    .allow_any_header();

App::new()
    .wrap(cors)
    // ... other app configurations
```

### 3.3 API Endpoints

OxidizedOasis-WebSands exposes a RESTful API for client applications to interact with the system.

#### 3.3.1 User-related Endpoints

- `POST /users`: Create a new user
- `POST /users/login`: Authenticate a user
- `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve user details
- `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user information
- `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user account

#### 3.3.2 Authentication Endpoints

- `POST /auth/refresh`: Refresh an existing JWT
- `POST /auth/logout`: Invalidate a JWT (for future implementation)

### 3.4 Frontend Interface

While the primary focus of OxidizedOasis-WebSands is the backend implementation, a basic frontend interface is provided for demonstration and testing purposes.

#### 3.4.1 Sign-up Page

A simple HTML form for user registration.

**Implementation:**

```html
<form id="signupForm">
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>

#### 3.4.2 Login Page

A form for user authentication.

#### 3.4.3 Dashboard Page

A protected page displaying user information and logout functionality.

These frontend components interact with the backend API to provide a complete user management experience.

## 4. Data Model

The OxidizedOasis-WebSands application uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data. This section describes the database schema and the relationships between different entities in the system.

### 4.1 Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following main tables:

#### 4.1.1 Users Table

The `users` table stores essential information about registered users.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

Fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user (UUID).
- `username`: The user's chosen username (must be unique).
- `password_hash`: The bcrypt hash of the user's password.
- `email`: The user's email address (optional, but must be unique if provided).
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the user account was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update to the user account.

#### 4.1.2 Sessions Table

The `sessions` table keeps track of active user sessions. This table is not currently implemented but is planned for future enhancements to support features like session management and forced logout.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_user_id ON sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_token ON sessions(token);
```

Fields:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each session (UUID).
- `user_id`: The ID of the user to whom this session belongs.
- `token`: The JWT token associated with this session.
- `expires_at`: The expiration timestamp of the session.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the session was created.

#### 4.1.3 User_Profiles Table

The `user_profiles` table stores additional, optional information about users. This table is not currently implemented but is planned for future enhancements to support more detailed user profiles.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    bio TEXT,
    avatar_url VARCHAR(255),
    date_of_birth DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Fields:
- `user_id`: The ID of the user to whom this profile belongs (foreign key to `users` table).
- `full_name`: The user's full name.
- `bio`: A brief biography or description provided by the user.
- `avatar_url`: URL to the user's profile picture.
- `date_of_birth`: The user's date of birth.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the profile was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last update to the profile.

### 4.2 Entity Relationships

The relationships between the entities in the OxidizedOasis-WebSands database are as follows:

1. **Users to Sessions** (1:N)
   - One user can have multiple active sessions.
   - Each session belongs to exactly one user.
   - This relationship is established by the `user_id` foreign key in the `sessions` table.

2. **Users to User_Profiles** (1:1)
   - Each user has at most one user profile.
   - Each user profile belongs to exactly one user.
   - This relationship is established by the `user_id` primary key in the `user_profiles` table, which is also a foreign key to the `users` table.

### 4.3 Data Access Layer

The data access layer in OxidizedOasis-WebSands is implemented using SQLx, which provides type-safe database interactions. Here's an example of how the data access layer is structured for the `User` entity:

```rust
use sqlx::FromRow;
use uuid::Uuid;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, FromRow)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub username: String,
    pub password_hash: String,
    pub email: Option<String>,
    pub created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    pub updated_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
}
```

async fn send_verification_email(user: &User) -> Result<(), EmailError> {
    let token = Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    
    // Store token in database with expiration
    store_verification_token(user.id, &token).await?;
    
    let email = Message::builder()
        .from("noreply@oxidizedoasis.com".parse().unwrap())
        .to(user.email.parse().unwrap())
        .subject("Verify Your OxidizedOasis Account")
        .body(format!("Click here to verify your account: https://oxidizedoasis.com/verify/{}", token))
        .unwrap();

    let mailer = SmtpTransport::relay("smtp.gmail.com")
