## Compliance and Best Practices

### GDPR Compliance (7/10)

#### Strengths:
- User data is protected with strong authentication mechanisms
- Users can request their data and delete their accounts

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Implement a clear data retention policy
- Ensure all user data can be exported in a machine-readable format

### OWASP Top 10 Awareness

| OWASP Top 10 Risk | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Injection | ✅ Mitigated |
| Broken Authentication | ✅ Addressed |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | ⚠️ Partially Addressed |
| XML External Entities (XXE) | ✅ Not Applicable |
| Broken Access Control | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| Security Misconfiguration | ⚠️ Needs Review |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | ✅ Mitigated |
| Insecure Deserialization | ✅ Addressed |
| Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities | ⚠️ Needs Regular Checks |
| Insufficient Logging & Monitoring | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |

### Regular Security Audits

- Implement quarterly security audits
- Conduct annual penetration testing
- Establish a bug bounty program for continuous security feedback
