# OxidizedOasis-WebSands Cybersecurity Review

## 🛡️ Input Validation and Authentication

### Input Validation
- ✅ Implemented for all user inputs
- ✅ Custom validation for passwords

### Authentication
- ✅ Using bcrypt for password hashing
- ✅ JWT for session management
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement rate limiting for login attempts

### Authorization
- ✅ Bearer token authentication for protected routes
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement role-based access control for more granular permissions

## 🔐 Data Protection

- ✅ Passwords are hashed before storage
- ⚠️ TODO: Encrypt sensitive data in the database (e.g., email addresses)

## 🌐 Network Security

### HTTPS
- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- ✅ CORS is configured, but limited to a single origin
- ⚠️ TODO: Review CORS settings for production environment

## 🚫 Injection Prevention

### SQL Injection
- ✅ Using parameterized queries with sqlx, which prevents SQL injection

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- ✅ Input sanitization is in place
- ✅ Using ammonia for HTML sanitization

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

## 🔍 Error Handling and Logging

### Error Handling
- ✅ Custom error responses are in place
- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure production errors don't leak sensitive information

### Logging
- ✅ Logging is implemented
- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure sensitive data is not logged in production

## 📦 Dependency Security

- ⚠️ TODO: Regularly update dependencies and run `cargo audit` to check for vulnerabilities

## 📧 Email Security

- ✅ Email verification implemented for new user registrations
- ⚠️ TODO: Add re-verification for email changes

## 🔑 Password Policies

- ✅ Password complexity requirements are in place
- ⚠️ TODO: Consider implementing password expiration and history policies

## 🚀 API Security

- ✅ Using HTTPS (assumed)
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement API rate limiting

## 🔄 Session Management

- ✅ Using JWTs for stateless authentication
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement token revocation mechanism (e.g., a blacklist for logged-out tokens)

## 📁 File Upload Security (Future Implementation)

- ⚠️ TODO: Implement strict file type checking and size limits

## ⚙️ Server Configuration

- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure proper server hardening in production (e.g., disable unnecessary services, use a firewall)

## 🗄️ Database Security

- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure least privilege principle is applied to database user
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement database connection encryption

## 🔏 Secrets Management

- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure all secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET) are properly managed and not hard-coded
