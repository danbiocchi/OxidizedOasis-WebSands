Cybersecurity Review:
Input Validation:
✅ Implemented for all user inputs.
✅ Custom validation for passwords.
Authentication:
✅ Using bcrypt for password hashing.
✅ JWT for session management.
⚠️ Consider implementing rate limiting for login attempts.
Authorization:
✅ Bearer token authentication for protected routes.
⚠️ Consider implementing role-based access control for more granular permissions.
Data Protection:
✅ Passwords are hashed before storage.
⚠️ Consider encrypting sensitive data in the database (e.g., email addresses).
HTTPS:
⚠️ Ensure HTTPS is enforced in production.
CORS:
✅ CORS is configured, but limited to a single origin.
⚠️ Review CORS settings for production environment.
SQL Injection:
✅ Using parameterized queries with sqlx, which prevents SQL injection.
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
✅ Input sanitization is in place.
✅ Using ammonia for HTML sanitization.
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
⚠️ No explicit CSRF protection. Consider implementing CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
Error Handling:
✅ Custom error responses are in place.
⚠️ Ensure production errors don't leak sensitive information.
Logging:
✅ Logging is implemented.
⚠️ Ensure sensitive data is not logged in production.
Dependency Security:
⚠️ Regularly update dependencies and run cargo audit to check for vulnerabilities.
Email Verification:
✅ Implemented for new user registrations.
⚠️ Consider adding re-verification for email changes.
Password Policies:
✅ Password complexity requirements are in place.
⚠️ Consider implementing password expiration and history policies.
15. API Security:
✅ Using HTTPS (assumed).
⚠️ Consider implementing API rate limiting.
Session Management:
✅ Using JWTs for stateless authentication.
⚠️ Consider implementing token revocation mechanism (e.g., a blacklist for logged-out tokens).
File Upload (if implemented in the future):
⚠️ Implement strict file type checking and size limits.
Server Configuration:
⚠️ Ensure proper server hardening in production (e.g., disable unnecessary services, use a firewall).
Database Security:
⚠️ Ensure least privilege principle is applied to database user.
⚠️ Implement database connection encryption.
Secrets Management:
⚠️ Ensure all secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET) are properly managed and not hard-coded.
